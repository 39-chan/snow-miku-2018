Hy! I'm Shiro39 (39-can is my second nickname if I can't choose Shiro39 in internet)

*this is gonna be the worst readme ever*
*but before you read the full readme, here is the link to the live demo*

I'm a big fan of the japanese virtual idol named Hatsune Miku.
As her big fan, I want to make something with Hatsune Miku theme.

Then, I wrote this page.

At first, I just wrote this page for personal use, and then I decide to share this page with
other Hatsune Miku fans.

I wrote this page based on gokoururi's page and I own nothing of the images I used in this page

All the images I used are owned by Piapro and Crypton Future Media
